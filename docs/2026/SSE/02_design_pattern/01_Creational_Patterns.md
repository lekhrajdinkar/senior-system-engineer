# Creational Patterns 
- Object creation done right
- Used when how objects are created matters.

## Singleton 
- One instance only (configs, connection pools)

## Factory Method 
- Subclasses decide which object to create

## Abstract Factory
- Factory of factories

## Builder 
- Construct complex objects step-by-step

## Prototype 
- Clone existing objects instead of creating new ones
