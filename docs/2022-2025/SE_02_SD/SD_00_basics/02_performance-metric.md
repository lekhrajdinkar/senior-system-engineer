# performance metric/s
## latency 
- tradeoff : latency vs accuracy.
- time it takes for data to travel from one point in a system to another.
- could be:
  - **network latency**, time for a request to go from client to server and back.
  - **machine latency**, time to read data from memory or disk.
  - ...

-- estimated time in microSec, to  --
read 1MB for Data from:
    memory - 250 
    SSD - 1000
    1GBPS network - 10k
    HDD - 20k
So there is latency always. no need to remeber, just of idea.

## throughput
- the amount of work a computer can perform within a given time.
- could be:
  - data transferred per second
  - no of http req per sec
