-  critical cybersecurity approach, especially with the increasing adoption of cloud environments.

  - Requires authentication, authorization, and encryption for all access requests
  - Protects against insider threats as well.

## ZTS Model
- micro-segmentation : Network is segmented into smaller, isolated networks
- least privilege
- Continuous Verification
- Adaptive Authentication
  - Security adjustments based on context (e.g., location, user behavior)
